= Documentation for Byte/Number Conversions

Documentation: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/slib/Byte_002fNumber-Conversions.html#Byte_002fNumber-Conversions[]

To use: +(import (slib byte-number))+

For more information including compatibility, examples and test cases, 
see https://github.com/petercrlane/r7rs-libs[]

Note: Some implementations fail conversions of some of the extreme values, 
for example representations of infinity or smallest possible numbers in range.
