== SLIB Introduction and Miscellaneous Libraries

indexterm:[slib]
SLIB is a collection of packages of Scheme code, mostly written by Aubrey
Jaffer, but some collected from other sources.  Looking through the files, some
of the original dates go back to 1991, and the precedence parser into 1989.  A
number of ideas now found in Scheme and captured in the SRFIs can be traced
back to SLIB.  The repackaged files in +r7rs-libs+ have been adapted to work
with R7RS Scheme implementations: using R7RS functionality, the library system,
and operations now found in SRFIs.  

SLIB's official documentation is available at http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/slib[]
and is still applicable, with some minor adjustments, to the version provided here.

There are 91 libraries within the R7RS SLIB collection.  These fall within four main 
groups of functionality:

. Textual Conversion Packages, including a parser, I/O routines, html and xml processing, 
  pretty-printing of Scheme objects, and procedures to handle times and dates.
. Mathematical Libraries, including prime numbers, some random number distributions, plotting 
  functions (to text and eps), root/limit finding libraries and a 3D modelling suite.
. Database Packages, which implement a relational database system, and a library for weighted
  trees.
. Other Packages
.. Data Structures: for enhancing arrays, working with pnm files, an object system and queues.
.. Sorting and Searching: trees, chapter-order, topological sort, along with some space filling 
   curves and sequence comparisons.
.. Other Procedures: a library of metric units for computing conversions.

The github page for +r7rs-libs+ and the wiki, https://github.com/petercrlane/r7rs-libs/wiki[],
provide additional information about SLIB and its conversion for use as R7RS libraries.  

The "examples" and "tests" directories provide (some) examples of using SLIB.  Limited 
documentation for some of the libraries follows.

This section introduces some of the smaller libraries in the SLIB collection.  The following 
chapters go into some of the libraries into more depth, especially those libraries related 
with a common theme such as array handling or time.

=== Database

indexterm:[database] indexterm:[relational database]
SLIB includes a relational database system, written entirely in Scheme.  This is a complex 
and inter-related set of libraries.  The following example (from "slib-examples/db-1.sps") 
provides an introduction to creating, opening and using a simple database.  

.Note
****
The database system stores information in files.  It also sets up locks on those 
files to prevent multiple users trying to change the same data.  The code has been 
tested under Linux, but requires further tests and possible modification on other 
operating systems.

If your application fails with any errors, it is possible the lock files will remain 
and must be deleted before you can access the database again: the lock files start 
".$" and ".#", and are thus hidden on Linux and similar systems.

More information on SLIB's database system is available at: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/slib/Using-Databases.html[].
After understanding the example below, work through section 6.1.2 on Table Operations.  

==== Creating a database

A database can be created using one or more "backends".  Currently, only an association list 
backend is supported, as provided by +(slib alist-table)+.  A database is created to a given filename:

[source,scheme]
----
(import (scheme base)
        (slib databases)
        (slib alist-table))

(define db (create-database "mydb" 'alist-table))
----

The above code imports the necessary libraries, and creates a database in the file "mydb" using 
an association-list backend.  A reference to this database is stored in +db+.

Next, the database can be opened:

[source,scheme]
----
(define rdb (open-database! db))
----

As we will see below, a database can be opened using either the database reference from the +create-database+ 
command, or from the filename.  So +(open-database! "mydb")+ works just as well.

Databases can be opened in _mutable_ or _immutable_ modes: opened to be changed, or just for reading.  
The exclamation mark ! indicates that the database is mutable.  

Data in a database is stored within _tables_.  Before we can use our new database, we need to create 
at least one table.  A table is defined from three elements:

. its _name_
. its _primary key field(s)_
. its _other fields_

In our example, we make an example with name "testit", a single primary key "id", and two fields "first" and "second".
Each field is defined with an associated type (allowed types are described in the
http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/slib/Catalog-Representation.html#Catalog-Representation[online] documentation).  
In this case, our "id" field will be a number, and the two other fields strings.

The basic definition is: 

----
(testit                                  ; the table name
  ((id number))                          ; list of primary key field (name type) pairs
  ((first string) (second string)))      ; list of other field (name type) pairs
----

When defining a table, we can also provide a list of data to add.  The data are simply given in rows, with values for all fields:

----
((1 "Peter" "Lane")   ; row 1: (id first second)
 (2 "Joe" "Smith"))   ; row 2: (id first second)
----

Putting the definitions together, the following line of code creates the +testit+ table, and adds some initial data:

[source,scheme]
----
(define-tables rdb '(testit ((id number)) ((first string) (second string))
                            ((1 "Peter" "Lane")
                             (2 "Joe" "Smith"))))
----

Finally, don't forget to close the database, which ensures everything is saved on disk:

[source,scheme]
----
(close-database rdb)
----

You can examine the file "mydb" to read the definition and data.

==== Working with a database

Databases should only need constructing once.  Afterwards, you will open and work with the 
existing file.  To open an existing database, you need to know its filename:

[source,scheme]
----
(define mydb (open-database! "mydb"))   ; open a mutable database
----

To access information in a table, you need to extract the table of interest:

[source,scheme]
----
(define table (open-table! mydb 'testit))
----

If you were to examine +table+, you would find it is a _procedure_.  The table 
procedure takes an operation definition as its argument, and returns a new procedure 
to perform that operation on some data.

For example, if we wish to retrieve a row of data.  The operation definition is +'row:retrieve+.
The returned procedure then takes the primary key(s) to locate in the database:

[source,scheme]
----
((table 'row:retrieve) 1)   ; returns the row with id 1: (1 "Peter" "Lane")
----

Try displaying all rows (note, the third case will return +#f+):

[source,scheme]
----
(display "Retrieving 1: ") (display ((table 'row:retrieve) 1)) (newline)
(display "Retrieving 2: ") (display ((table 'row:retrieve) 2)) (newline)
(display "Retrieving 3: ") (display ((table 'row:retrieve) 3)) (newline)
----

A new row can be inserted in a similar way:

[source,scheme]
----
((table 'row:insert) '(3 "Jane" "Wheeler"))
----

Further row operations exist to update and delete.

Operations are also available to work on multiple rows.  A useful case is +for-each-row+:

[source,scheme]
----
((table 'for-each-row) (lambda (row) (display "Row: ") (display row) (newline)))
----

Finally, don't forget to close the database, which ensures everything is saved on disk:

[source,scheme]
----
(close-database mydb)
----
