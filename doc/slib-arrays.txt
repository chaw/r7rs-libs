== SLIB Array Libraries

SLIB provides a number of libraries for defining and working with arrays.  
The array type used is SRFI 63, which was originally a package in SLIB.
SRFI 63 provides functions to create, modify and examine arrays.

The collection includes:

* +array-for-each+: Functions for applying functions to arrays.
* +array-interpolate+: Functions to reduce/resample arrays.
* +byte+: A library for arrays of small integers (although R7RS includes +bytevector+,
  several libraries in SLIB make use of byte).
* +determinant+: A number of standard matrix-algebra functions.
* +subarray+: Functions to reduce or access sub-arrays.
