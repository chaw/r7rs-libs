== Introduction

The R7RS Libraries referred to here are a collection of libraries written for
or, mostly, repackaged for R7RS Scheme.  The library implementations 
are available from https://github.com/petercrlane/r7rs-libs[].

The collection has been tested on Chibi, Gauche, Kawa, Larceny and Sagittarius
implementations (in R7RS mode, if necessary).  Any incompatibilities or test
failures are noted in +README.md+.  In most cases, the collection will work
on other R7RS implementations.  However, there are some dependencies.  For
example, +(slib directory)+ requires some interaction with the operating
system, which is platform specific.  Most of the individual libraries rely on
one or more SRFIs.  Those SRFIs not currently included with the tested
implementations are included in this collection, as are some R6RS libraries.

See https://github.com/petercrlane/r7rs-libs/blob/master/LICENSE.md[] for license information.

=== Getting Started

Many of the libraries are available from http://snow-fort.org/pkg[] and 
can be downloaded directly using +snow-chibi+ or a similar client.

The collection can be obtained directly and in full by downloading or cloning
from the github link above.  The directories are named according to each group
of libraries.  Those directories ending "-examples" or "-tests" are not needed
if you are only interested in using the libraries (but are a good source of
examples to learn from).

In most cases, using the libraries from your implementation is straightforward.
If the directory containing the files is SCHEME_LIBS, you must call your
implementation with SCHEME_LIBS in its library path.  e.g.

----
    > chibi-scheme -I SCHEME_LIBS -I SCHEME_LIBS/srfis/chibi program.sps
    > gosh -r7 -I SCHEME_LIBS -I SCHEME_LIBS/srfis/gauche program.sps
    > larceny -path SCHEME_LIBS -r7rs -program program.sps
    > sagittarius -r7 -L SCHEME_LIBS -L SCHEME_LIBS/srfis/sagittarius program.sps
----

Note that Larceny has all required SRFIs to support the complete collection.
For the others, you also need to reference the implementation-specific SRFIs,
in the directory SCHEME_LIBS/srfis/IMPLEMENTATION.

(Your implementation may support alternative ways to define the location of libraries.)

.Kawa

For use in Kawa I recommend precompiling the collection into class files.  The
script +build-kawa+, for bash or msdos, compiles the complete collection and packs
it into a single jar file: +r7rs-libs.jar+; the compiler produces some warnings, 
mostly of unused functions, which can be ignored.

Either:

* Add this jar file to your +CLASSPATH+ for use within Kawa.
* Alternatively, for making the collection permanently available, place the .jar file in your 
  kawa/lib directory, and add the .jar file to the list in +KAWA_EXTRA_PATH+ in the relevant 
  kawa/bin script.

.Kawa note: names with colons
****
Kawa uses the colon to access properties of a value, such as fields or methods, 
as explained in https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/Colon-notation.html[].

This sometimes causes problems in interpretation: one solution is to rename
names with colons on import, or use the | ... | vertical bar syntax when
referring to the library names.

=== Documentation

This document begins with the libraries under the +robin+ subcollection, as
these are written by myself.  These libraries cover a range of functionality,
including a logger, statistics library, an implementation of Lisp's Series
package, and a range of functions for working with text.  Each library is
covered in a separate chapter.

The remaining chapters cover collections repackaged from other sources.  These include
SLIB and a range of smaller collections.  Most of these have their own documentation, 
which is linked to.  Some examples and descriptions are provided for libraries that 
particularly interest me, or which lack alternative information.  SLIB's libraries 
cover a range of topics, and important topics are covered in separate chapters.

.Help Wanted
****
Many of the ported libraries have inadequate documentation / examples, making them hard 
to pick up and get started with.  Send me examples to include in the repository.  Write 
documentation on your web pages or blogs, or send to include here.

[appendix]
== Information on Library Imports

The following tables show, for each library, the non-R7RS imports which it
requires, and also the libraries that it is imported into - no libraries
such as +(scheme base)+ are shown.  The intention is to help decide which 
additional libraries you need to include when adding a library to an application.
e.g. +(robin statistics)+ relies on SRFIs 1, 27, 69 and 95. 

(WARNING: The lists do not currently list libraries imported using
+cond-expand+ statements.  For example +(robin text)+ requires SRFI 13 or
equivalent functions from other libraries.)

These tables are automatically generated from the individual library source files.
