== Introduction

The R7RS Libraries referred to here are a collection of libraries written for
or, mostly, repackaged for R7RS Scheme.  The library implementations 
are available from https://github.com/petercrlane/r7rs-libs[].

The collection has been tested on Chibi, Kawa, Larceny and Sagittarius
implementations.  Any incompatibilities or test failures are noted on the
github page.  In most cases, the collection will work on other R7RS
implementations.  However, there are some dependencies.  For example, +(slib
directory)+ requires some interaction with the operating system, which is
platform specific.  Most of the individual libraries rely on one or more SRFIs.
Those SRFIs not currently included with the tested implementations are
included, as are some R6RS libraries.

See https://github.com/petercrlane/r7rs-libs/blob/master/LICENSE.md[] for license information.

=== Getting Started

The collection can be obtained by downloading or cloning from the github link
above.  The directories are named according to each group of libraries.  Those
directories ending "-examples" or "-tests" are not needed if you are only
interested in using the libraries (but are a good source of examples to learn from).

In most cases, installation is straightforward:

Some of the libraries are available from http://snow-fort.org/pkg[]

Alternatively, download the entire collection as a zip file and unpack, or
clone the repository, using the 'Clone or Download' button on the github
repository.  If the directory containing the files is SCHEME_LIBS, you must
call your implementation with SCHEME_LIBS in its library path.  e.g.

----
    > chibi-scheme -I SCHEME_LIBS -I SCHEME_LIBS/srfis/chibi program.sps
    > larceny -path SCHEME_LIBS -r7rs -program program.sps
    > sagittarius -r7 -L SCHEME_LIBS -L SCHEME_LIBS/srfis/sagittarius program.sps
----

Note that Larceny has all required SRFIs to support the complete collection.
For Chibi and Sagittarius, you also need to reference the implementation-specific SRFIs, 
in the directory SCHEME_LIBS/srfis/IMPLEMENTATION.

.Kawa

For use in Kawa I recommend precompiling the collection into class files.  The
script +build-kawa+, for bash or msdos, compiles the complete collection and packs
it into a single jar file: +r7rs-libs.jar+

Either:

* Add this jar file to your +CLASSPATH+ for use within Kawa.
* Alternatively, for making the collection permanently available, place the .jar file in your 
  kawa/lib directory, and add the .jar file to the list in +KAWA_EXTRA_PATH+ in the relevant 
  kawa/bin script.

.Kawa note: names with colons
****
Kawa uses the colon to access properties of a value, such as fields or methods, 
as explained in https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/Colon-notation.html[].

This sometimes causes problems in interpretation: one solution is to rename
names with colons on import, or use the | ... | vertical bar syntax when
referring to the library names.

=== Documentation

Most of this document describes the libraries under the +robin+ subcollection.  These 
libraries cover a range of functionality, including a logger, statistics library, 
an implementation of Lisp's Series package, and a range of functions for working with 
text.  Each library is covered in a separate chapter.

The remaining chapters cover collections repackaged from other sources.  These include
SLIB and a range of smaller collections.  Most of these have their own documentation, 
which is linked to.  Some examples and descriptions are provided for libraries that 
particularly interest me, or which lack alternative information.

.Help Wanted
****
Many of the ported libraries have inadequate documentation / examples, making them hard 
to pick up and get started with.  Send me examples to include in the repository.  Write 
documentation on your web pages or blogs, or send to include here.

[appendix]
== Information on Library Imports

The following tables show, for each library, the non-R7RS imports which it
requires, and also the libraries that it is imported into - no libraries
such as +(scheme base)+ are shown.  The intention is to help decide which 
additional libraries you need to include when adding a library to an application.
e.g. +(robin statistics)+ relies on SRFIs 1, 27, 69 and 95. 

(WARNING: The lists do not currently list libraries imported using
+cond-expand+ statements.  For example +(robin text)+ requires SRFI 13 or
equivalent functions from other libraries.)

These tables are automatically generated from the individual library source files.
