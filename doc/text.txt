== Text: +(import (robin text))+

indexterm:[text] The text library contains a collection of functions for working with strings or 
text documents.

=== daitch-mokotoff-soundex

The indexterm:[daitch-mokotoff-soundex] indexterm2:[Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex]
algorithm is a variant of the Russell Soundex algorithm, designed to work
better for Slavic and Yiddish names.  The implementation here uses the table
from http://www.jewishgen.org/InfoFiles/soundex.html[].

#|kawa:6|# (daitch-mokotoff-soundex "LONDON")

#|kawa:10|# (daitch-mokotoff-soundex "LEVINSKI")

For some words, multiple codes are possible - pass an optional second argument +'all+ to get a list of codes:

#|kawa:2|# (daitch-mokotoff-soundex "auerbach")
097500
#|kawa:3|# (daitch-mokotoff-soundex "auerbach" 'all)

=== hamming-distance

The indexterm2:[+hamming-distance+] is the number of mismatched items between two equal-length sequences.
The +hamming-distance+ function takes two arguments and an optional comparison procedure.  The sequences 
can be strings, lists, vectors or bytevectors.  The comparison procedure defaults to +char=?+ for strings,
+=+ for bytevectors, and +equal?+ for everything else.

[source,lisp]
----
#|kawa:2|# (hamming-distance "This string" "that strong")
4
#|kawa:3|# (hamming-distance "This string" "that strong" char-ci=?)
3
#|kawa:4|# (hamming-distance #(1 2 3 4) #(0 2 3 5))
2
----

=== levenshtein-distance

The indexterm2:[+levenshtein-distance+] counts the minimum number of
insertions/deletions/substitutions to convert one sequence into another.  The
+levenshtein-distance+ function takes two arguments and an optional comparison
procedure.  The sequences can be strings, lists, vectors or bytevectors.  The
comparison procedure defaults to +char=?+ for strings, +=+ for bytevectors, and
+equal?+ for everything else.

#|kawa:2|# (levenshtein-distance "sitting" "kitten")

#|kawa:3|# (levenshtein-distance "Saturday" "sunday")

#|kawa:4|# (levenshtein-distance "Saturday" "sunday" char-ci=?)

=== metaphone

The indexterm:[metaphone] indexterm2:[Metaphone Algorithm] was created as an improvement on Soundex, better 
taking account of variations in English pronounciation.  The algorithm was created by Lawrence Philips, in 
"Computer Language" December 1990 issue.  There have been many published variants of Metaphone.  A summary 
can be found at http://aspell.net/metaphone/[].

The +metaphone+ function simply takes a word to convert into a coded representation of its sound:

[source,lisp]
----
#|kawa:2|# (metaphone "smith")
SM0
#|kawa:3|# (metaphone "smythe")
SM0
#|kawa:4|# (metaphone "lewinsky")
LWNSK
#|kawa:5|# (metaphone "levinski")
LFNSK
----

Note, the output code is all upper-case letters, with "0" standing in for "TH".

=== optimal-string-alignment-distance

indexterm2:[+optimal-string-alignment-distance+] is a modification of the
Levenshtein distance to include transpositions as well as deletions, insertions
or substitutions.  A transposition is where two characters have been swapped,
such as when typing too quiclky.  The +optimal-string-alignment-distance+
function takes two arguments and an optional comparison procedure.  The
sequences can be strings, lists, vectors or bytevectors.  The comparison
procedure defaults to +char=?+ for strings, +=+ for bytevectors, and +equal?+
for everything else.

[source,lisp]

> (levenshtein-distance "kitten" "sitting")

> (optimal-string-alignment-distance "kitten" "sitting")
3
> (levenshtein-distance "this string" "that strnig")
4
> (optimal-string-alignment-distance "this string" "that strnig")
3
----

Notice the difference between the two algorithms in the last case, where "n" and "i" have 
been transposed.

=== porter-stem

indexterm2:[+porter-stem+] is an implementation of the well-known indexterm2:[Porter Stemming Algorithm], for 
reducing words to a base form.  More details of the algorithm are at https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/[]

The function simply takes the word to change, and returns the stemmed form:

[source,lisp]
----
> (porter-stem "running")
"run"
> (porter-stem "apples")
"appl"
> (porter-stem "apple")
"appl"
> (porter-stem "approximation")
"approxim"
> (porter-stem "sympathize")
"sympath"
> (porter-stem "sympathise") 
"sympathis"
----

=== russell-soundex

indexterm2:[+russell-soundex+] is the same as +soundex+, exported from +(slib soundex)+

=== sorenson-dice-similarity

indexterm2:[+sorenson-dice-similarity+] returns a measure of how similar two strings are, based 
on n-grams of characters.  An optional third argument provides the number 
of characters in the n-grams, which defaults to 2:

[source,lisp]
----
> (sorenson-dice-similarity "rabbit" "racket")
1/5
> (sorenson-dice-similarity "sympathize" "sympthise")
10/17
> (sorenson-dice-similarity "sympathize" "sympthise" 1)
8/9
> (sorenson-dice-similarity "sympathize" "sympthise" 3)
2/5
----

=== soundex

indexterm2:[+soundex+] is the same as +soundex+, exported from +(slib soundex)+.  

=== string->n-grams

indexterm2:[+string->n-grams+] separates a string into overlapping groups of +n+ letters.

[source,lisp]
----
> (string->n-grams "ABCDE" 1)
("A" "B" "C" "D" "E")
> (string->n-grams "ABCDE" 3)
("ABC" "BCD" "CDE")
----

For +n+ greater than the length of the string, the string itself is returned.
If +n+ is less than 1, an error is raised.

=== words->with-commas

indexterm2:[+words->with-commas+] is a function taking a list of strings and 
adding commas in between the items up to the last item, which is preceded 
by an "and".  For example:

[source,lisp]
----
> (words->with-commas '())
""
> (words->with-commas '("apple"))
"apple"
> (words->with-commas '("apple" "banana"))
"apple and banana"
> (words->with-commas '("apple" "banana" "chikoo"))
"apple, banana and chikoo"
> (words->with-commas '("apple" "banana" "chikoo" "damson"))
"apple, banana, chikoo and damson"
> (words->with-commas '("apple" "banana" "chikoo" "damson") #t)
"apple, banana, chikoo, and damson"
----

An optional second argument controls whether the final "and" should be 
preceded by a comma.  The default is not to have the comma.

=== word-wrap

indexterm2:[+word-wrap+] takes two arguments, a string and a target width.  It
returns a list of strings, each item in the list representing a line of text.
Each line is formatted so words do not go beyond the target width.  The
algorithm is a simple greedy algorithm.  If a single word is longer than the
target width, it is allowed to overlap.

For example, setting:

[source,lisp]
----
(define *text* "Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary. Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today.")
----

We can wrap to a width of 50 characters using:

[source,lisp]
----
> (word-wrap *text* 50)
Programming languages should be designed not by
piling feature on top of feature, but by removing

demonstrates that a very small number of rules for
forming expressions, with no restrictions on how
they are composed, suffice to form a practical and
efficient programming language that is flexible
enough to support most of the major programming
paradigms in use today.

and we can wrap to a width of 60 characters using:

[source,lisp]
----
> (word-wrap *text* 60)
