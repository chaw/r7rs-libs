== Repackaged or Ported Libraries

Most of the libraries available in this collection have been repackaged or
ported from earlier versions of Scheme, or Lisp, to work under R7RS Scheme
implementations.  Modifications have been kept to a minimum to make the code
work.  Test scripts and examples are available for some parts of these
libraries and may be examined for ideas on how each library works. 

This chapter provides an overview of these repackaged collections: some of 
these have links to their own detailed documentation.

=== Natural Language Tool Kit: +(import (nltk NNNN))+

indexterm:[nltk]
A repackaging of libraries from the Natural Language ToolKit: https://sourceforge.net/projects/snltk/[]

*    dfsa
*    lang-en
*    lang-hr
*    n-grams
*    sequence
*    vectorspace

(Not the +cgi+ package, as the necessary support libraries are not present.)

These libraries support natural-language processing tasks, such as dividing text into n-grams, analysing or 
displaying the n-grams, and working with a deterministic finite-state automaton.

Some tests and examples are provided, but otherwise this collection needs documenting.

=== Purely Functional Data Structures: +(import (pfds NNNN))+

indexterm:[pfds]
A repackaging of _Purely Functional Data Structures_, originally written for R6RS Scheme: https://github.com/ijp/pfds[]

These data structures implement algorithms from a variety of sources (see the README at above link).

*    bounded-balance-tree
*    deque
*    difference-list
*    fector: Functional Vectors, from https://github.com/ijp/fectors[]
*    fingertree
*    hash-array-mapped-trie
*    heap
*    priority-search-queue
*    queue
*    sequence
*    set

And, to support implementation:

*    alist
*    bitwise
*    lazy-list
*    list-helpers
*    vector

Some tests and examples are provided, but otherwise this collection needs documenting.

=== R6RS: +(import (r6rs NNNN))+

indexterm:[r6rs]
As many of the libraries have been ported from R6RS implementations, they depend on some 
R6RS functionalities - particularly fixnum arithmetic and bytevectors.  Some of these 
have been taken from http://snow-fort.org[] in support of the repackaging (particularly for Weinholt).

=== Rebottled

indexterm:[rebottled]
Some libraries ported from older Scheme versions or Common Lisp: these libraries are individual 
or very few files.

include::rebottled-pdf.txt[]

==== JSON

indexterm:[json]  A collection of JSON utilities provided by Takashi Kato for R6RS.  
See https://github.com/ktakashi/json-tools[] for more details and documentation.

Four packages:

* +(import (rebottled json))+
* +(import (rebottled json-parser))+
* +(import (rebottled json-select))+
* +(import (rebottled json-tools))+

==== Packrat: +(import (rebottled packrat))+

indexterm:[packrat]
Packrat parser library by Tony Garnock-Jones. 

* Documentation: http://tech.labs.oliverwyman.com/downloads/dev.lshift.net/tonyg/packrat.pdf[]
* General Information: http://bford.info/packrat/[]

==== Portable Regular Expressions: +(import (rebottled pregexp))+

indexterm:[pregexp]
Written by Dorai Sitaram, this library is documented at:
http://ds26gte.github.io/pregexp/index.html[]

==== Quaternions: +(import (rebottled quaternions))+

indexterm:[quaternions]
Written by Dorai Sitaram, this library is documented at:
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/squat/squat.html[]

The quaternions library extends the Scheme numeric tower. 

==== Schelog: +(import (rebottled schelog))+

indexterm:[schelog]
Written by Dorai Sitaram, this library is documented at:
https://ds26gte.github.io/schelog/index.html[]

=== SRFI: +(import (srfi NN))+

indexterm:[srfi] The +r7rs-libs+ include some SRFIs required by this 
collection for those implementations which do not otherwise provide them.  

For documentation on the SRFIs, see http://srfi.schemers.org/final-srfis.html[]

=== Weinholt Industria: +(import (weinholt NNNN))+

indexterm:[weinholt]
This collection is only partially repackaged for R7RS Scheme, as some of the code requires 
support from the implementation (such as for the networking) or use of syntax case.  
The implemented portion contains a collection of algorithms for working with (some) compression 
algorithms and performing cryptography.  

Documentation is available at: https://weinholt.se/industria/manual/[]

See https://github.com/petercrlane/r7rs-libs[] for information on which libraries are currently available.
