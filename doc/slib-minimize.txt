=== Minimize: +(import (slib minimize))+

The Golden Section Search algorithm can find minima of functions
where derivatives are expensive to compute or unavailable.  

==== golden-section-search

indexterm2:[+golden-section-search+] takes four arguments:

. the function to minimize (of one argument)
. the lowest value of +x+ to search from
. the highest value of +x+ to search to
. a stopping condition for the search, which is one of
.. a positive number defines a target tolerance
.. a negative number is negated to define the number of iterations
.. a function of +(x0 x1 a b fa fb count)+ ends the search by returning +#t+

The function returns a dotted pair: the value of +x+ for the minimum and +f(x)+

<1> Find the minimum of the +square+ value in range (-10, 10) for 100 iterations
<2> The minimum is x=0 and (square x)=0

The following example minimizes its function to within the specified tolerance:

----
sash[r7rs]> (golden-section-search (lambda (x) (+ (* x x x) (* -2 x) -5)) 0 1 (/ 10000)))
